#' Compute daylength (photoperiod) for a latitude and date.

#' date format is 'yyyy-mm-dd'
#' this function called daylength calculates the daylength (photoperiod) for a latitude and date.
#' day length should stay the same if it's the same day even in a different year 
#' this shows that it does stay the same

#' we can extract the day length for every day of the year at a given latitude with this

#' We can plot day length and it shows that as expected that it spikes in summer and declines towards winter
